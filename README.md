13 Key WordPress-Functions
==========================

<p>
  After a few years (or even month, really) of designing and developing WordPress themes, especially for clients, you start to realize that a lot of the functionality can be standardized or distilled down into a "starter theme or kit". 
  This helps get the development process started and moving along apace. 
</p>

<p>
  The best first step in doing this, I've found, is to nail down most of the common functions and include them in the <code>functions.php</code>. 
  This <code>functions.php</code> file will need to be extended to meet the particular theme needs as new projects arise, but it'll provide a more than awesome starting point for development.


  There are about 13 key functions that I like to start out with and will add to them as needed. These include:

<ol>
  <li>Custom Menu Support</li>
  <li>Visual Editor Style</li>
  <li>Default Custom Avatar</li>
  <li>Post Formats</li>
  <li>Featured Image</li>
  <li>Attachment Display Settings</li>
  <li>Feed Links (RSS)</li>
  <li>Load Text Domain (translation ready)</li>
  <li>Content Width Definition</li>
  <li>Dynamic Sidebar(s)</li>
  <li>Custom "more" Link</li>
  <li>Basic Pagination</li>
  <li>Register and Enque Scripts &amp; Styles</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    Extras:
    <ul>
      <li>Redirect After Theme Activation</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
